# NUnit Playground#

The goal of this Kata is to learn NUinit framework.


## Highlights ##
- Naming convention UnitOfWork_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior
- Parameterize tests with the TestCase attribute
- Learn ReSharper shortcuts
- **Not working yet:** Try to find test name formatter for the NUnit that produces human-readable names (similar to the MSpec). 

## Mocking Framework ##
Tried to use NSubstitute mocking framework. Not happy with the readability of the resulting code.
